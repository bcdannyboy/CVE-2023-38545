# CVE-2023-38545: Curl Vulnerability Proof of Concept
This repository contains a comprehensive Proof of Concept (PoC) designed to test systems for the CVE-2023-38545 vulnerability. The vulnerability affects the curl utility, specifically versions between 7.69.0 and 8.3.1, and is related to the handling of HTTP redirects.

## Prerequisites
Required Software: curl

## Features
- SOCKS5 Proxy Server running on port 1080
- HTTP Server running on port 8000
- Automated script to test for the vulnerability


## Architecture
The PoC consists of two main components:

- SOCKS5 Proxy Server: Listens on port 1080 and forwards all incoming requests to the HTTP server.
- HTTP Server: Listens on port 8000 and is responsible for generating the payload that triggers the vulnerability.

## Usage Instructions
### Step 1: Launch the Servers
Execute the following command to start both the SOCKS5 and HTTP servers:

    $ python3 server.py

You can also run the server with debug logging

    $ python3 server.py --debug

Upon successful execution, the SOCKS5 server will be listening on port 1080, and the HTTP server will be listening on port 8000. All incoming requests to the SOCKS5 server will be automatically forwarded to the HTTP server, irrespective of the actual request data.

### Step 2: Execute the Exploit Script
First, make the script executable:

    $ chmod +x cve202338545.sh

The script can be configured to accept a socks5 proxy address with `--socks5-ip` and an http address with `--http-ip` *but note that for now the proxy only forwards requests to the local PoC server*

    $ ./cve202338545.sh --socks5-ip <ip> --http-ip <ip> # specify both proxy and http server
    $ ./cve202338545.sh --socks5-ip <ip> # specify only proxy server
    $ ./cve202338545.sh # both proxy and http server will default to localhost

This will initiate the exploit, and you should see output indicating whether the system is vulnerable, not vulnerable, or if the test was inconclusive.

### Step 3. Analyze Results

There are 4 response states:

    - [*] System is vulnerable to CVE-2023-38545
    - [*] Inconclusive, likely not vulnerable
        - triggered when the vulnerable version is identified but a request does not return any errors
    - [*] Inconclusive, further investigation needed
        - triggered when the vulnerable version is identified but the request returns an error that isn't a heap buffer overflow or segmentation fault
    - [*] System is not vulnerable to CVE-2023-38545 

## TODO

- [ ] add better support for socks5 connections so I don't have to hardcode the HTTP connection

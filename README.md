# CVE-2023-38545: Curl Vulnerability Proof of Concept
This repository contains a comprehensive Proof of Concept (PoC) designed to test systems for the CVE-2023-38545 vulnerability. The vulnerability affects the curl utility, specifically versions between 7.69.0 and 8.3.1, and is related to the handling of HTTP redirects.

## Prerequisites
Required Software: curl

## Features
- SOCKS5 Proxy Server running on port 1080
- HTTP Server running on port 8000
- Automated script to test for the vulnerability


## Architecture
The PoC consists of two main components:

- SOCKS5 Proxy Server: Listens on port 1080 and forwards all incoming requests to the HTTP server.
- HTTP Server: Listens on port 8000 and is responsible for generating the payload that triggers the vulnerability.

## Usage Instructions
### Step 1: Launch the Servers
Execute the following command to start both the SOCKS5 and HTTP servers:

    $ python3 server.py

Upon successful execution, the SOCKS5 server will be listening on port 1080, and the HTTP server will be listening on port 8000. All incoming requests to the SOCKS5 server will be automatically forwarded to the HTTP server, irrespective of the actual request data.

### Step 2: Execute the Exploit Script
First, make the script executable:

    $ chmod +x cve202338545.sh

The script can be configured to accept a socks5 proxy address with `--socks5-ip` and an http address with `--http-ip` *but note that for now the proxy only forwards requests to the local PoC server*

    $ ./cve202338545.sh --socks5-ip <ip> --http-ip <ip> # specify both proxy and http server
    $ ./cve202338545.sh --socks5-ip <ip> # specify only proxy server
    $ ./cve202338545.sh # both proxy and http server will default to localhost

This will initiate the exploit, and you should see output indicating whether the system is vulnerable, not vulnerable, or if the test was inconclusive.

### Step 3. Analyze Results
If the system is vulnerable, the script will output the following:

    [*] System is vulnerable to CVE-2023-38545

If the system has the proper version but the connection did not trigger the vulnerability, the script will output:

    [*] Inconclusive, likely not vulnerable

If the connection timed out after the triggering request was made, the script will output:

    [*] Likely Vulnerable (Timeout)

Otherwise, the script will output:

    [*] System is not vulnerable to CVE-2023-38545 (<reason>)

Feel free to use or modify this as you see fit, just give me credit if you use it anywhere!
